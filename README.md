A software developer, interested in making efficient and innovative solutions. Dedicated to continuous learning, skill development and to working with great people. 

I have experience in working JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Spring Boot, GIT, Unit & Integration testing and have touched the surface of React with TanStack Router and Query.

My three most favourite projects are:
* Flight Planner - Java application with Spring Boot, featuring airport/flight search, flight addition, and admin/customer access. Managed backend with dBeaver.
* Trivia Game - Java terminal game presenting API-retrieved questions with randomised answer choices.
* Theatre Ticket Selling - Java multithreading program simulating ticket rush, ensuring correct sales by synchronising ticket list access and handling unavailability.
